    <p class="menyitem">Hello, thank you for visiting this website.</p>
    <p class="menyitem">I build this website during my studies at University West's Webmaster programme in 2022.
        It is built using PHP and a connection to a PHPMyAdmin database, the application displays events ordered by date and the
        admin user can add and delete events after logging in. The application is protected from SQL injections and all
        passwords are securely hashed.</p>
    <p>Thank you for the visit.</p>
